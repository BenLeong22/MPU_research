Sally Pearson ran the fastest 100m hurdles in Olympic history to win a gold medal at the London Olympics. Pearson is currently the fifth fastest women's hurdler of all-time, with the overall world record unbroken since 1988. She also held all four major international titles at the one time - Olympic, world, world indoor and Commonwealth titles. She is the first Australian to win a gold medal on the Olympic athletics track since Cathy Freeman in 2000, and only the second in more than 20 years. It's a fact that Pearson finds crazyo but may go some way to explaining what her accomplishments have meant to her country. Pearson can trace her ambition back to when she was 13 years old and watched Cathy Freeman triumph in the Sydney Olympics. The secret, she says is 'really just belief, it's believing in yourself and giving it a crack and knowing that you can do it.' This inspiring story traces the highs and lows of her athletics career u from the Commonwealth Games where a disqualification turned her world upside down u to the injuries she has fought to overcome. But despite the hurdles life has put in her way, Sally has always been single-minded in the pursuit of her goals, and always believed she could achieve them.","14","20","15","10","10","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1"

For Willa Jacobs, seeing her best friend, Jane Weston, is like looking in a mirror on a really good day. Strangers assume they are sisters, a comparison Willa secretly enjoys. They share an apartment, clothing, and groceries, eking out rent with part-time jobs. Willa writes advertising copy, dreaming up inspirational messages for tea bags, while Jane cleans houses and writes poetry about it. Together Willa and Jane are a fortress of private jokes and shared opinions, with a friendship so close there's hardly room for anyone else. But when Ben, Willa's oldest friend, reappears and falls in love with Jane, Willa wonders: Can she let her two best friends find happiness with each other if it means leaving her behind?

 My social studies teacher, Mr. VanDoy, never smiles. I know that's hard to believe, because everybody smiles about something, right?  

   

   

 Isabella smiles when her brothers get in trouble. Angeline smiles when she thinks about how much prettier she is than, like, a waterfall or a unicorn. I smile when I think about a unicorn kicking Angeline over a waterfall. But Mr. VanDoy doesn't smile at all. I wonder if when you become an adult, you can lose your sense of humor the way you lose your teeth or hair or fashion sense.

And now that her worst never-imagined worry has happened - her utterly best friend is moving away forever - Clarice doesn't even care about her tickets to the Ruby Redfort, girl detective, film premiere. That is, unless something happens to change things again ...Lauren Child's trademark wit combines with spot-on insight in this hugely engaging story about childhood worries, unwanted changes and finding friendships in the most surprising places.

Origami Yoda pleads with Tommy and Kellen to save Dwight by making a new case file--one that will show how Dwight's presence benefits McQuarrie.

--Washington Post 

 

 



 

 

""As with this story's predecessor, the well-observed middle-school dynamics (and Angleberger's sharp sense of humor) are greatly amplified by the book's design, which includes faux wrinkled pages, abundant doodles, and other scrawled marginalia. It's a natural step up from the Wimpy Kid series, with more text and narrative complexity, but just as much on-target humor and all-around fun."" --Publishers Weekly   ""This book is honest, funny, and immensely entertaining.

 Radius Limpfast is one of the world's richest men. His reality TV shows have made him billions. The next series is always greater than the one before, and yet he is never satisfied. Then one night, after a particularly creative bacon curry, Radius dreams up the ultimate reality show. No matter whatever anyone else comes up with, they will never be able to top it.

The whole world will tune in to watch. This will be reality TV at its finest. What could possibly go wrong?

In the city of Boschenberg stands Madame Opera's Estimable Marine Society for Foundling Boys and Girls. Within its walls lives an orphan named Rossamund. A young boy with a girl's name. He is about to embark on a journey that will change his life forever. Rossamund has always dreamed of a career in the Navy, fighting tentacled monsters and rescuing damsels from hook-handed pirates. But fate has chosen him for a different path. He is being sent to train as a Lamplighter - to bring light to the inland roads of the Half-Continent, to shine the way for travellers through lands peopled by outcasts, monsters and worse. But for Rossamund to begin his education, he must first undertake a journey of his own: to the great city of High Vesting. Such a road is not for the faint of heart. Only monster-hunters, leers and the most desperate of brigands dare travel the inland ways unguarded. And all Rossamund carries with him is a battered almanac and a pocketful of cheap potions. It is unlikely to be enough. Stunning in scope and rich in detail, alive with memorable heroes and villains and brimming with new and original science and magics, D.M. Cornish's tale of scolds, scourges, smugglers and shrewds will thrill and captivate, and leave the reader desperate for more.

Fate lends a hand, when Will instead finds himself on a quest with the mysterious Rune-master, to recover the lost treasure of the Dark Forest - a quest which is far more dangerous! Comedy fantasy series written for children, with a bit of an edge.

With a film tie-in cover, this book will be a hit with children and adults alike. THE STORY BEGINS in the first volume of Hiccup's How to Train Your Dragon memoirs... Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III was an awesome sword-fighter, a dragon-whisperer and the greatest Viking Hero who ever lived. But it wasn't always like that. In fact, in the beginning, Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III was the most put upon Viking you'd ever seen. Not loud enough to make himself heard at dinner with his father, Stoick the Vast; not hard enough to beat his chief rival, Snotlout, at Bashyball, the number one school sport and CERTAINLY not stupid enough to go into a cave full of dragons to find a pet... It's time for Hiccup to learn how to be a Hero. How to Train Your Dragon is soon to be a DreamWorks film starring Gerrard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill, out in March 2010 adapted from the best selling How to Train Your Dragon series by Cressida Cowell. Read the rest of Hiccup's exploits in the How to Train Your Dragon series in How to Be a Pirate, How to Speak Dragonese, How to Cheat a Dragon's Curse, How to Twist a Dragon's Tale, A Hero's Guide to Deadly Dragons, How to Ride a Dragon's Storm, and How to Break a Dragon's Heart.

Having been mentored by his hometown newspaper's publisher, a survivor of the civil rights turmoil, he now passes these stories along to students far too young to have experienced or, in some cases, even heard about them. But when a long-lost friend suddenly returns to Loring, where years ago her family had been shattered by an act of spectacular violence, Luke begins to realize that his connection with her runs deeper, both personally and politically, than he ever imagined. Just children in 1962, they had no sense of what was happening when James Meredith's enrollment at Ole Miss provoked a bloody new battle in the old Civil War, much less its impact on their fathers' ambiguous friendship. Once his daughters leave for Ole Miss, and with his marriage at an impasse, Luke's investigation of this decades-old trauma soon spills over into his own life. With his parents unwilling, or unable, to help him unlock secrets whose existence he'd never suspected, this amateur historian is soon entirely consumed by an obscure past he can neither explain nor control'a gripping reminder that the past isn't dead, or even past.

Robert Falcon Scott's famous words uttered on the polar plateau don't paint Antarctica in the best possible light. In fact things were about to get a whole lot worse for Scott and the four men who accompanied him to the South Pole. But this is no dismal tragedy. The story of Captain Scott's Terra Nova expedition is pure adventure with all the elements of a great epic - storms at sea, impenetrable ice pack, man-eating whales, crevasses, blizzards, scientific discovery, bad food, extreme temperatures, and equal measures of hunger, agony and snow blindness. With a cast of memorable characters, vicious dogs and reluctant ponies, Captain Scott plans to be first to reach the South Pole. Will the weather hold? Will the rations be adequate? How will they know when they get there? And who invited the Norwegians? Into the White will leave you on the edge of your seat, hoping against hope that Scott and his men just might survive their Antarctic ordeal and live to tell the tale.","18","20","20","1","19","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1"

- I can keep all my thoughts safe in a private blog, and I won't have to worry about anyone stealing my diary (finally)!

- The Beans have a huge show coming up, and we can make sure everyone knows about it!

Reasons why our musical is going to be amazing:



 

 

- I could be the star!

- Landon could be my co-star . . . which means we'll hang out together.

- Working on the sets, props, music, script, and costumes will be tons of fun.

 

 



There's so much to do, I'd better get started!



 

 



Between her crush, the musical, and her friends--not to mention school work--Zee is torn in a thousand different directions. With all the real-life drama going on, will she lose sight of what's really important?

 I went five whole days without seeing or hearing from Angeline. I was beginning to get used to it. It's true that I have learned to overlook many of Angeline's flaws, like her flawlessness, but she can still be difficult to be around. Like when she's lit perfectly, for example.  

   

   

 To my extreme credit, I have learned to pretend to ignore Angeline's failure to not be perfect.","5","3","0","9","2","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0"

When you start to explore this question, you find out how elusive it really is. Are you a physical body? A collection of experiences and memories? A partner to relationships? Each time you consider these aspects of yourself, you realize that there is much more to you than any of these can define. In The Untethered Soul, spiritual teacher Michael A. Singer explores the question of who we are and arrives at the conclusion that our identity is to be found in our consciousness, the fact of our ability to observe ourselves, and the world around us. By tapping into traditions of meditation and mindfulness, Singer shows how the development of consciousness can enable us all to dwell in the present moment and let go of painful thoughts and memories that keep us from achieving happiness and self-realization.  

   

   

 The Untethered Soul offers a frank and friendly discussion of consciousness and how we can develop it. In part one, Singer examines the notion of self and the inner dialogue we all live with. Part two examines the experience of energy as it flows through us and works to show listeners how to open their hearts to the energy of experience that permeates their lives. Ways to overcome tendencies to close down to the rest of the world are the subject of part three. Enlightenment, the embrace of universal consciousness, is the subject of part four. And finally, in part five, Singer returns to daily life and the pursuit of unconditional happiness. Throughout, the book maintains a light and engaging tone, free from heavy dogma and prescriptive religious references. The easy exercises that figure in each chapter help listeners experience the ideas that Singer presents.","8","5","10","10","5","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1"

Created by Susannah McFarlane, the series editor, the series is written by established authors Tony Wilson, Andrew Daddo, Philip Gwynne, Will Kostakis, Oliver Phommavanh, Scot Gardner, Justin D'Ath, James Roy, Pat Flynn and Alex McDiarmid. Each book features a different character and follows them as they overcome a particular everyday challenge. It explores those everyday struggles in life that boys can sometimes be reluctant to express: quarrels with mates, a bad day at school, fear of disappointing mum and dad, rejection and not fitting in.

 
 

Stuff Happens. Real-life stories for boys. Suitable for beginner and newly confident readers.

 
 

Stuff happens sometimes. Everyday stuff.

 
 

At school, at home, with sport, with mates.

 
 

For Lennie it happened when he argued with a teacher.

**Praise for Stuff Happens**

 
 

'Stories about boys, aimed at boys and containing real-life stories of their school and home life are rare. Even rarer are those that have readily identifiable characters and situations, and engage, amuse and inform. But here they are.'

 
 

'An exciting new series written specifically for boys aged from seven to eleven . . . great additions for school libraries and for engaging reluctant boy readers. Outstanding!' **Read Plus**

 
 

'The fantastic Stuff Happens series **.' reviewZOO**

 
 

'I love a book that talks in a kid's voice. It makes us feel important and special. The thing I like the most about these books are that they tell different perspectives of everyday things in life.' **Mr 10 - Readingtree.com.au**

 
 

'The awareness of the emotional life of boys is slowly being recognised as a critical factor into the development of boys to be strong and courageous sensitive men. Stuff Happens explores feelings and emotions in an entertaining and humorous way, allowing boys to understand that it is OK to express emotion. This can only be positive! I highly recommend and love the books!' **Deborah Jepsen, Educational and Developmental Psychologist -**  **Melbourne Child Psychology / School Psychology Services**

 
 

'As a mum to two boys aged 8 and 10, I was thrilled to find a book series that provided very real 'boy dilemmas' and connected feelings and behaviours, which can be really confusing for boys. What was even more exciting was how much the boys ate it up. My eldest read the first book in one sitting and I was back at the bookshop the next day to buy the entire series! My youngest loved being read to and was so engaged and interested in all the characters and their issues. Can't wait for the next instalment.' **Marita Evans - Mum to Rupert, 10, and Henry, 8**","10","10","15","10","10","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1"

Terrier is basically a rookie cop's story, in which the rookie comes across two truly ugly cases. ""Beka is a slum kid who was brought into the household of the realm's top cop, the Lord Provost, eight years ago,"" Pierce said in an interview. ""Now, at 16, she's returning to the slums of her childhood as a Puppy, which is what the Provost's Guards, or Dogs, call their rookies. Her life expectancy in this year is slim: Police work in this medieval-esque setting is hard and nasty, and even veterans don't always survive. Beka's lucky to have two of the best Dogs for her trainers, and she'll need them. Hers is a truly brutal world of tavern brawls, murder-for-hire, rivalry between thieves and murderers and those who profit from their work and those who will kill to keep their secrets. She's facing someone who is kidnapping children and killing them if their parents won't pay up and a man who slaughters the crews who dig treasure for him so they won't give away what they are doing."" Pierce said that Beka is cool, tough and shy and has a powerful but subtle kind of magic.

Bart Simpson, the much-maligned, misunderstood, under-appreciated 'underachiever', comes clean and (God help us!) it's worse than we thought. Now the truth can be told at last as Bart offers up his school survival guide, secret codes, pullable pranks, dream tattoos, favourite El Barto 'tags', and the Christmas list to end all lists (and future visits from Santa). It's the worst, we mean . the best book ever!



 

 



In The Simpsons Library of Wisdom, Matt Groening, the creator of 'The Simpsons', offers an ongoing series of portable and quotable books that will eliminate the need for all religions and philosophies, exalt man's role in the universe and make the world a better place ... sort of. No other television show in history has commented so freely and so humorously on modern times, and there seems to be no end in sight for the sharp satire and pointed parody that 'The Simpsons' serves up every night of the week all around the world.

Eden is keen to study this plant further for its magical properties, however, her precious Plant Spell Book is still in Garton the Ghastly s possession. Garton, meanwhile, has tricked the fairies into believing he can t read and that the book is useless to him, so that they don t suspect he is plotting another evil plan to overthrow them. But he is planning the biggest nasty surprise of them all to march on the fairy castle itself and attack, with the help of his loyal goblin army, some enormous fierce flytraps and, his most important weapon, the qilin, who, with the help of the spell book, Garton has turned from a kind friend to the fairies into a vicious, angry beast who obeys his every evil command. But the fairies are a lot smarter than Garton had counted on, and, after a spectacular and dramatic battle, they employ some of their most unusual and powerful magic plus an ingenious idea involving Fafnir the Dragon to ward off the goblin army and save their home. Eden discovers a way to return the qilin to its normal self using the magical fire flower, and the fairies celebrate their narrow victory.

'I want to tell you that he's coming home. . . and it's going to be like it was before he went away, before everything broke apart.'

 
 

Nella waits for the swallows by the creek each spring. It's a secret vigil she's followed ever since her father left.

**_For the forest of a bird_**

 
 

'Highly recommended . . . In this delicate, finely balanced tale, Sue Saliba explores grief, loss and the inevitability of change.' _Good Reading Magazine_

 
 

http://www.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/book\_details.cfm'book=17191&page=15

 
 

'Quietly unfolding through sparse, beautifully written sentences, is a friendship between two like-minded girls who dive deep into the natural world. Birds and forests, loss and love. It's one of those novels where 'not much happens' and yet so much does. The title - _For The Forest of A Bird_ - is taken from Judith Wright's poem 'The Birds' and it was the carefully chosen name that drew me to this book. Looking at the jacket once finished, I couldn't help but feel this is a novel that is as precious and rare as the birds and native forests Nella and her new friend Isobel explore. Highly recommended for keen, sensitive readers of 12 and up.' _Books in Print_

 
 

http://booksinprint.blogspot.com.au/2015/02/bip-enews-books-for-young-readers.html

 
 

'Saliba's latest book is a beautiful poetic dream of consciousness story of a young girl's love, sadness, resilience and acceptance of the things she cannot change. It is a story about growing up. This is a novel that quietly sings. Highly recommended 13+.' _Reading Time: Children's book news and reviews from the Children's Book Council of Australia_

 
 

http://readingtime.com.au/for-the-forest-of-a-bird/

 
 

'Everybody should discover Sue Saliba. Her novels are such special things - they make you think differently and laterally about language and form, her young characters deal with such heavy emotions but are lightened by their connection to nature and family. _For the Forest of a Bird_ is another beautiful outing by this superb Australian author - I loved it, and ate up the words in one afternoon.

If you have not read anything about the Baudelaire orphans, then before you read even one more sentence, you should know this: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are kindhearted and quick-witted, but their lives, I am sorry to say, are filled with bad luck and misery. All of the stories about these three children are unhappy and wretched, and this one may be the worst of them all.If you haven't got the stomach for a story that includes a hurricane, a signalling device, hungry leeches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain, and a doll named Pretty Penny, then this book will probably fill you with despair.I will continue to record these tragic tales, for that is what I do. You, however, should decide for yourself whether you can possibly endure this miserable story.

Meanwhile, Garton the Ghastly, the new Goblin King, has found Blaize s old broken guitar, and has started playing it and creating havoc for the gnomes and pixies. The only way he can be stopped from playing his hypnotic tunes is by Blaize playing his new guitar and undoing the old guitar s magic.

Puck meets the Mistral Tree, the rarest tree in the Wild Woods, Eden meets the grumpy singing sirens, and Cedar goes to the Hissing Volcano where she encounters the most unusual gentle beast, the qilin. Astara gets the flower fairies to help her find the magical starberries, which play the most important role of all they tempt the dangerous Chimera from the Wild Forest, and, while it eats the berries, she uses a magical spell and the power of her sceptre to summon a rainbow.

Fairy artisans create Blaize s new guitar and he happily fixes the goblin king s hideous music. However, Garton is not happy, and wants revenge

A carnival is a place for good family fun - as long as one has a family, that is. For the Baudelaire orphans, their time at the carnival turns out to be yet another episode in a now unbearable series of unfortunate events.

With millions of readers worldwide, and the Baudelaires fate turning from unpleasant to unseemly, it is clear that Lemony Snicket has taken nearly all the fun out of childrens books.

There was an animal in Tasmania whose nocturnal screeches sounded like the devil and a river creature that had a duck's bill at one end and a beaver's tail at the other. The Europeans had never seen anything like these animals before and gave them names similar to those of the European creatures they already knew. They drew and painted odd pictures of them, showing they did not understand the animals' habits.

Shot by one of Puck s love arrows while staring at a mirror, poor Fafnir is now singing endless love songs to himself. If only his singing were good.

Astara summons Puck, the love fairy, to remove the arrow and stop Fafnir s singing. With the help of his friend Blaize, he tries to do so but fails. the only way to break the spell over Fafnir is to find another dragon for him to love, and that is when they decide to ask the Sea Fairy for help. the Sea Fairy introduces them to Warawan, the gentle water dragon who lives with her. and while the meeting between Fafnir and Warawan does not go exactly to plan, it certainly does result in peace and magic for Faraway IslandTeachers's guide and fun activities available to download from the website www.farawayfairies.com.au

and this is where the crows take her brother.  

So begins an adventure that will take Prue and her friend Curtis deep into the Impassable Wilderness. There they uncover a secret world in the midst of violent upheaval, a world full of warring creatures, peaceable mystics, and powerful figures with the darkest intentions. And what begins as a rescue mission becomes something much bigger as the two friends find themselves entwined in a struggle For The very freedom of this wilderness.

Wildwood is a spellbinding tale full of wonder, danger, and magic that juxtaposes the thrill of a secret world and modern city life.

With dozens of intricate and beautiful illustrations by award-winning artist Carson Ellis, Wildwood is truly a new classic For The twenty-first century.

Many had seen their cities destroyed by US bombers. Food, fuel and materials were in short supply. Yet spirits remained high. In April 1945, Yoko Moriwaki started high school in Hiroshima, excited to be a prestigious Ã¢Â²KenjoÃ¢Â² girl, and full of duty towards her parents, school and country. But the country was falling apart and in four months time her city would become the target for the first atomic bomb ever used as a weapon. In her diary, Yoko provides an account of that time - when conditions were so poor that children as young as twelve were required to work in industry; when fierce battles raged in the Pacific and children like Yoko believed victory was near. With additions by YokoÃ¢Â²s relatives and fellow students, and an introduction by award-winning author Paul Ham, YokoÃ¢Â²s Diary not only shows us the hopes, beliefs and daily life of a young girl in wartime Japan, it is a touching account of the consequences of the first nuclear bombing of a city.","18","20","19","4","10","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1"
